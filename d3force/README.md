Applying `d3-force` layout for slicing and exploring EU-SILC data
---

**About**

This page provides relevant tools used to prepare selected social indicator data downloaded from [ESTAT website](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database) and provide an interactive display based on [`d3-force` layout](https://github.com/d3/d3-force). These tools aim at reusing the material developed by S.Carter for the _New York Times_ publication mentioned below [below](#References) so as to provide with a similar visualisation.

**Description**

The webpage [_peps01_slice.html_](https://github.com/gjacopo/bodylanguage/blob/master/d3force/peps01_slice.html) illustrates some important figures related to ESTAT indicator _ilc_peps01_ on *people at risk of poverty or social exclusion* by age and sex (see also the  news release [below](#References)). The front page (first tab selected) looks like this:
<table>
<tr>
<td><kbd><img src="peps01-d3force.png" alt="PEPS01 display"></kbd></td>
</tr>
</table>

**Usage** 

**To actually see the interactive visualisation, you need to download the webpage and display it locally in your browser.** You can get a preview of this page using `rawgit`: **check this [address](https://cdn.rawgit.com/gjacopo/bodylanguage/b245c372/d3force/peps01_slice.html) for quick rendering/visualisation**, though the display is much slower and some of its features are disabled.

All _html/javascript/css_ resources used by the original _"Four ways to slice..."_ publication have been embedded in the webpage _peps01_slice.html_. The code has been modified accordingly so as to visualise  specifically the selected data  (see `javascript` variables `estat.rate_data_total`, `estat.category_list` and `estat.category_data`).

We provide hereby two `Python` modules that will enable you to prepare the selected social indicators data for the visualisation:
* [`data.py`](data.py) contains the classes/methods that will help you download the data from ESTAT website;
* [`display.py`](display.py) contains the classes/methods that will enable you to format the data to be inserted in the webpage.

Note in particular that `display.py` implements some circle packing algorithms for optimally filling a circle with other circles: this is used to position the circle centers in the initial overall display. 

Data requested for the visualisation proposed in _peps01_slice.html_ webpage are formatted in the [`peps01_slice.py`](peps01_slice.py) script. They are output as `json` but can be copied 'as is' in the webpage source code.
